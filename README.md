# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

The head of a top travel technology company, which specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry, needed help to collect and present data for customers via the search page. Customers use search to filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. The tasks are as follows:
- Use the NumPy module to generate more than 2000 random latitudes and longitudes.
- Use the citipy module to list the nearest city to the latitudes and longitudes.
- Use the OpenWeatherMap API to request the current weather data from each unique city in the list.
- Parse the JSON data from the API request.
- Collect the following data from the JSON file and add it to a DataFrame:
  - City, country
  - Latitude and longitude
  - Maximum temperature
  - Humidity
  - Cloudiness
  - Wind speed
  - Weather Description
- Retrieve customer weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, 
- Show the probable destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
- Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. 
- Create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
